# 🧬 Architecture overview

## 🏛️ Structure

### 1. 🎯 Problem Statement and Context

Many people from everywhere are going to join in this online chat game, the challenge is to keep the system available for 24/7 with no downtime.
The user cannot feel any impact of having software updates, actually the user would never know when a new version was released.
People will be sending and reciving messages all the time from anyone to anyone, the system must be fast, with very low latency.

### 2. 🎯 Goals

1. Very low latency! Messages from user to other user should be delivered in ~1s.
2. Close to zero downtime, the system should be resilient and have disaster recovery mecanism.
3. The system should be able to scale easily due the nature of the problem.
4. Solution should follow cloud-native principles like Container-based, API-based, Independently scalable, Reliable and Portable.
5. Observability is mandatory, be able to see software behavior, collect metrics, create insights, etc.
6. Built-in solid principles, like isolation, independent, soa and soc.
7. Embbeded quality with flavors of tests: unit test, contract test, integration test, stress test and chaos test.

### 3. 🎯 Non-Goals

1. Realtime message delivery.
2. Monolithic solution.
3. Mobile-native technology is not allowed, we want one app for IOS and other app for Android.
4. Lombok library is forbidden.
5. Custom shared libraries are forbidden.
6. Clean code principles are forbidden.

### 📐 4. Principles

1. Customer centric.
2. Use composition over heritance. Try to decouple componentes as much as we can.
3. Observability first, expose metrics and logs to enable tracking and monitor anything.
4. Use idempotency to prevent duplications and improve distributed integrity.
5. Think on async calls when design the features.
6. Use smaller API contracts as much as we can, and versioning is a requirement.

## 🧭 6. Trade-offs

### Major Decisions: 
1. Build native mobile app for Android and iOS instead of using cross-platform app.
2. We're using multi region EKS cluster in order to reduce latency all over the world.
3. We're using RDS replica cross-region in order to reduce latency all over the world.
4. Choose managed Elastic Cache instead of redis cluster.

### Tradeoffs:
1. Native mobile vs Cross-platform
    - PROS (+) 
      * Native Apps Have the Best Performance.
      * Native Apps Have Lower Risks of Bugs.
      * Native Apps Receive Fast Updates.
    - CONS (-)
        * Higher Costs Involved With Native Apps
2. EKS vs ECS
   - PROS (+)
     * Reduce latency over the world due multiple availability zones.
   - CONS (-)
     * Operational overhead due responsible for maintaining and operating the worker nodes in your cluster.
3. Cross-region replica vs Single region
   - PROS (+)
     * Minimize latency by maintaining object copies in AWS Regions that are geographically closer to the users.
   - CONS (-)
     * Could have replication lag.
4. Elastic Cache vs Redis
   - PROS (+)
     * Minimize operational overhead due fully managed service for Redis.
   - CONS (-)
     * Higher costs involved with elastic cache

### 🌏 7. For each key major component

#### 7.1 Incoming message handler
It's responsible to send messages from one user to another using WebSockets.

##### Class diagram

![Send message service](send-message-service-class-diagram.drawio.png "Send message service")

##### Contract documentation

Send/receive message event subscription:
```
/v1/message-handler
```

Send message event payload:
```json
{
  "content": "String",
  "to": "String"
}
```
Server receives the event and send the message to target user represented by field `to`.

Receive message event payload:
```json
{
  "content": "String",
  "from": "String",
  "date": "Date" // format (yyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss)
}
```

#### 7.2 Submitting answer

Any request that requires data from current user, should be authenticated.
API should identify the user by the token provided in the request header.

This API is to submit the answers for a quiz.

Request
```json
POST /v1/quiz/answer
"user-token": "String"
{
  "quizId": "String",
  "answers": ["String"]
}
```

    // websocket security
    // no date in payload, it got by backend
    // two mechanism of transport, should be clear ws vs http
    // identify header in payloads
    // explain what are those fields in payloads
    // what is most important scenarios, give examples
    // what breaks the consumer
    // it tests more clear about scenarios
    // change format of tables

Response 
```json
HTTP 200
{
  "score": Integer
}
```

#### 7.3 Listing all matches

Any request that requires data from current user, should be authenticated.
API should identify the user by the token provided in the request header.

This API is to retrieve all matches from the user.

Request
```json
GET /v1/match
"user-token": "String"
```

Response
```json
HTTP 200
{
  "matches": [
    {
      "id": "String",
      "score": Integer,
      "date": "Date" // format (yyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss)
    }
  ]
}
```


### 🖹 8.0 Algorithms/Data Structures

[//]: # (Spesific algos that need to be used, along size with spesific data structures.)

TBD 


### 💾 9. Migrations

No DB Migration is needed here.

### 🧪 10. Testing strategy

- Unit tests 
  - Will be implemented using JUnit and Mockito.
  - Need to cover most important scenarios and edge cases.
  - This is the first line of defense. It will be running in developer machine and CI/CD pipeline.

- Contract tests
  - It will reduce the chances of one contract change breaks any consumer.
  - It will be running in developer machine and CI/CD pipeline.

- Integration tests
  - Not all scenarios should be covered, just most important ones.
  - It will be running in developer machine and CI/CD pipeline right after the build.

- Performance tests
  - Will be implemented using Gatling.
  - It will be running in CI/CD pipeline and pointing to production.

- Chaos tests
  - Test the system's ability to withstand turbulent and unexpected conditions like network latency, server failure, etc.
  - It will be running in CI/CD pipeline and pointing to production.


### 👀 11. Observability strategy

[//]: # (Explain the techniques, principles,types of observability that will be used, key metrics, what would be logged and how to design proper dashboards and alerts.)

TBD 

### 🖹 12. Data Store Designs

![jack-chat-game-db.drawio.png](jack-chat-game-db.drawio.png)

#### Partitioning
- Data partition by list of months based on created date of record.

#### Main queries

- Looking for quiz answers.
```sql
select * from quiz_answer where quiz_id = ? 
```

- Getting all messages from chat
```sql
select * from message where from_account_id = ?
```

- Getting all matches from user
```sql
select * from match where account_id = ?
```


### 🖹 13. Technology Stack

[//]: # (Describe your stack, what databases would be used, what servers, what kind of components, mobile/ui approach, general architecture components, frameworks and libs to be used or not be used and why.)

TBD
