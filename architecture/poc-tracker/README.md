# POC Tracker

## Problem

MR Bill, wants a system to keep track of his favorite pocs, so you need to build a mobile app where mr Bill can register all his pocs, and also he needs to be able to search pocs, by name, by language and by tags. 

This system should be multi-tenant because mr bill will sell such system to bunch of people in brazil, such system must have also ability to generate repots and generate a video with the all pocs the users did in 1 year. 

Such system must be secure and have proper login and be able to support Realtime dojos using mr bill platform you will build for him.
