Our CTO MR Fast want the smallest latencies possible. 

He cares deeply how things render and how fast they render. 

Right now the whole website is running on React 16. 

You need to find ways to speed up rendering and make sure rendering is fast all times. 

Mr Fast also has a monolith written in Java 1.4 which needs to be migrated to Java 21.
