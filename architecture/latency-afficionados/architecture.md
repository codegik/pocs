#### Problem space
<br/>Latency is a key concern for the CTO.


**Problem 1:**
<br/>The UI must be fast and the current React 16 implementation is not meeting the performance requirements.
<br/>The goal is to find ways to speed up the rendering process and ensure that the UI is fast at all times.
<br/>Could we upgrade and tune React to be faster enough?
<br/>Could we use different technology to improve the performance of the UI?

**Problem 2:**
<br/>The monolith is very old and needs to be migrated to Java 21.
<br/>The monolith should be decomposed into smaller, more manageable services to improve maintainability and performance.
<br/>Could we rewrite the monolith in Java 21 and still meet the performance requirements?
