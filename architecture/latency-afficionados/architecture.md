## 1 üéØ Problem Statement and Context

Latency Afficionados is a RETRO video game marketplace where users can sell RETRO video games and users can also buy such video games.

The platform is capable of:

- posting products
- search products
- view product descriptions
- rating products with review
- comments
- provide recommendation of products to users based on previews browsing
- sell/buy video games



### 1.1 Problem space
<br/>Latency is a key concern for the CTO.


#### 1.1.1 First Problem
<br/>The UI must be fast and the current React 16 implementation is not meeting the performance requirements.
<br/>The goal is to find ways to speed up the rendering process and ensure that the UI is fast at all times.
<br/>Could we upgrade and tune React to be faster enough?
<br/>Could we use different technology to improve the performance of the UI?

**Option 1:**
<br/>
<br/>Upgrade React to the latest version and use React Hooks to improve the performance of the UI.

**Option 2:**
<br/>
<br/>Use a different technology like Svelte to improve the performance of the UI.
<br/>Svelte is a new technology that compiles the code to vanilla JavaScript at build time,
<br/>which means that there is no need for a virtual DOM and the code is faster to execute.
<br/>Here is an performance comparison between React and Svelte:
<br/>

<br/>Svelte excels in terms of bundle size, initial load time, render time, memory usage, and CPU usage due to its
<br/>compile-time optimizations and lack of virtual DOM.
<br/>
<br/>React offers a more mature ecosystem with a wide range of libraries, third-party tools, and a larger community,
<br/>making it ideal for complex, large-scale applications.
<br/>

**Websockets**
<br/>Websockets are faster than traditional http protocol, here are the advantages:
<br/>Persistent connection: Once established, the connection remains open, reducing overhead for subsequent messages.
<br/>Full-duplex communication: Allows simultaneous two-way communication between client and server.
<br/>Lower latency: After the initial handshake, data can be sent immediately without additional HTTP headers.
<br/>Reduced server load: Fewer connections need to be opened and closed repeatedly.
<br/>Real-time updates: Ideal for live data, chat applications, gaming, etc.
<br/>Less data transfer: Smaller message sizes due to reduced header information.

#### 1.1.2 Second Problem
<br/>The monolith is very old and needs to be migrated to Java Latest Stable.
<br/>The monolith should be decomposed into smaller, more manageable services to improve maintainability and performance.
<br/>Could use gradual migration strategy. First, could use tools to assist the migration like AI or OpenRewrite. Second, 
<br/>start decomposing the monolith into microservices.
<br/>Here is a decomposition propose:
- Product Service: Handles product listing, details, and search
- User Service: Manages user accounts and authentication
- Review Service: Handles product ratings and reviews
- Recommendation Service: Provides product recommendations
- Order Service: Manages the buying and selling process
- Comment Service: Handles user comments on products


## 2. üéØ Goals
- Improve UI Performance
- Migrate and Modernize the Backend
- Enhance User Experience
- Maintain Scalability and Observability

## 3. üéØ Non-Goals
- Support for Legacy Browsers
- Backward Compatibility with Java 1.4
- Custom Hardware Optimization


## üìê 4. Principles
1. Performance-First Design: Prioritize low-latency and high-performance solutions in both frontend and backend systems.
2. Incremental Migration: Ensure the migration from the monolith to microservices is gradual, minimizing disruption to users.
3. Observability: Expose metrics and logs to enable tracking and monitor latency.
4. User-Centric Optimization: Continuously optimize the system based on user behavior and feedback to enhance the overall experience.
