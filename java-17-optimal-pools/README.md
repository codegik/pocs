Dad Pig wants to bring Peppa and George to the marvelous swin park runned by Miss Rabbit. George forget his dinossaur(Oh no) and now Dad pig drives home to find the damn bloody animal(I mean flufly animal). When Dad pig gets home he sees there is a message on the computer, saying:
```
Attention Parents!
​
Potatos swiming park(PSP) has multiple pools, they are all have the same lenght(L) and Width(W), L==W. However what make them quite different is the Deepth(D). For the dads you might want to goto pool with most D and for the children maybe the least D.
​
PSP has n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, deepth[i]).
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a potato swiming pool.
Here is an array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
​
Please plan your trip to the pool acordinly.
​
PS: Always remeber to eat your 5.
Super Potato,
CEO@PSP
```
Help Dad pig to write a computer program to find the optimal pool for Dad/Mommy pig and Peppa/George.
The plan output should look like:
```
  {
    "parent_most_deepth_area": "49",
    "kidos_least_deepth_area": "4",
  }
```

## Running
```shell
javac OptimalPool.java

java OptimalPool
```
