# Scrabble Score 

## Requirements

Bash 4 or higher

## Problem

Given a word list, compute the Scrabble score for each word in the list. Then find the word with biggest score.

### Letter Values

You'll need these:

| Letter                          | Value |
|---                              |---:|
|A, E, I, O, U, L, N, R, S, T     |  1  |
|D, G                             |  2  |
|B, C, M, P                       |  3  |
|F, H, V, W, Y                    |  4  |
|K                                |  5  |
|J, X                             |  8  |
|Q, Z                             |  10 |

### Limitation

You cannot use more than two loops.
